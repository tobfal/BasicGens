# Basic Gens

A 1.18 mod providing ForgeEnergy generators. Inspired by
rwtema's [ExtraUtilities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extra-utilities)
and cpw's [Iron Chests](https://github.com/cpw/ironchest).
Big thanks to Kaupenjoe and his [Forge Course](https://github.com/Kaupenjoe/Forge-Course-118),
which helped me understand 1.18 modding.
